ðŸ”¹ How It Works

A machine learning model (trained on SMS/Email dataset) processes the input text.

The model converts the text into numeric features (using techniques like TF-IDF/CountVectorizer).

The classifier (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, etc.) predicts Spam or Ham.

Flask shows the result on the webpage with colored highlight:

Red â†’ Spam

Green â†’ Ham
